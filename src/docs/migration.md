Miniflux 2.x is not backward compatible with Miniflux 1.x.

### Differences between Miniflux 1.2 and Miniflux 2.0

- Miniflux 2 supports multiple attachments.
- Miniflux 2 uses categories instead of groups, only one category can be assigned to a feed.
- Miniflux 2 have fewer settings.
- Miniflux 2 doesn't have public RSS feed or cronjobs.
- Miniflux 2 doesn't use API tokens anymore, for the Fever API, choose your own password and for the REST API use your account password.
- Miniflux 2 stores favicons into the database instead of using the local filesystem.
- Miniflux 2 themes are embedded into the application.
- Miniflux 2 doesn't support RTL languages.
- Miniflux 2 supports only Postgresql.
- Miniflux 2 is written in Go (Golang) instead of PHP.

### OPML Import

If you don't care about your previous data, export your feeds from Miniflux 1.x in OPML and import them into Miniflux 2.

### Migration Script

There is a migration script in the [archived repository](https://github.com/miniflux/v1): `scripts/migrate-v2.php`.

- This script requires direct access to the old and the new database.
- The first group linked to a feed will become the category associated with the imported feed.
- Only bookmarked items are migrated.
- Since entries are not identified in the same way in Miniflux 2, you may have duplicated entries when refreshing your imported feeds.

#### Step 1

Make sure you are using the latest version of Miniflux 1.2.x.

#### Step 2

Install Miniflux 2 without creating any users. Create only the database
schema (just run the migrations).

#### Step 3

Go into the Miniflux 1.2.x directory and run the script:

```bash
php scripts/migrate-v2.php --dsn="pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=miniflux2;user=postgres;password=postgres"

Destination is "pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=miniflux2;user=postgres;password=postgres"
* 2 user(s) to migrate
* Migrating user: #254 => #284
* Migrating integrations
* Migrating categories
* Migrating feeds
* Migrating entries
[...]
```

The script takes the [PDO DSN](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.connection.php#refsect1-ref.pdo-pgsql.connection-examples) of Miniflux 2 database as argument. Adjust the parameters to your own environment.

To import your old database to the new database format, use this script:

```bash
php scripts/migrate-db.php --sqlite-db=/path/to/my/db.sqlite --admin=1
```

The script is located in the Git repository (not in the archive).
